### >> Installation :
<br/>

1. First, open a terminal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Then, go into your Django project or start your virtual environment if you have one :

    Example :
```
> cd my_projects/my_django_project
```
<br/>
<br/>
3. Finally, execute :
```
> pip install neo4j_for_django
```
or if it doesn't work :
```
> python -m pip install neo4j_for_django
```
<br/>
<br/>
4. To check if all works fine, you can execute this in the terminal :
```
> neo4j_for_django -v
```
   If no error message is raised, that's good.  
   (You could also try to import the **neo4j_for_django** package in a file of your project.
